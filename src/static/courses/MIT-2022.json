Feminist research involves rethinking disciplinary assumptions and methodologies, developing new understandings of what counts as knowledge, seeking alternative ways of understanding the origins of problems/issues, formulating new ways of asking questions and redefining the relationship between subjects and objects of study. Focus on methodology, i.e., the theory and analysis of how research should proceed. Special attention to epistemological issues--pre-suppositions about the nature of knowledge. What makes research distinctively feminist lies in the complex connections between epistemologies, methodologies and research methods. Explore how these connections are formed in the traditional disciplines and raise questions about why they are inadequate and/or problematic for feminist inquiry and what, specifically, are the feminist critiques of these intersections.","prereqs":"Must apply to the Graduate Consortium in Women's Studies","offering":"Currently Offered","semester":["Summer","Spring"],"in-charge":"Lantz, Stacey (Class Admin)","year":"2022","master_subject_id":"WGS.615","fall_instructors":["Information: Graduate Program in Women's Studies"],"spring_instructors":["Information: Graduate Program in Women's Studies"],"is_variable_units":"N","courseNumber":100.615,"sortDigitNumber":3,"sortCourseNumber":null,"sortCourseDecimalNumber":0.615,"course_eval":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://edu-apps.mit.edu/ose-rpt/subjectEvaluationSearch.htm?termId=&departmentId=&subjectCode=WGS.615&instructorName=&search=Search\"> Course Evaluation for WGS.615</a>","Instructor":["Information: Graduate Program in Women's Studies"]},{"type":"Class","id":"WGS.645","label":"Issues of Representation: Feminist Theory","shortLabel":"Feminist Theory","level":"Graduate","total-units":12,"units":"3-0-9","course":"WGS","description":"Syllabi vary depending on instructors.","prereqs":"Application to the Graduate Consortium in Women's Studies","offering":"Currently Offered","semester":["Spring"],"in-charge":"Lantz, Stacey (Class Admin)","year":"2022","master_subject_id":"WGS.645","fall_instructors":["Consult Graduate Program in Women's Studies"],"spring_instructors":["Consult Graduate Program in Women's Studies"],"is_variable_units":"N","courseNumber":100.645,"sortDigitNumber":3,"sortCourseNumber":null,"sortCourseDecimalNumber":0.645,"course_eval":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://edu-apps.mit.edu/ose-rpt/subjectEvaluationSearch.htm?termId=&departmentId=&subjectCode=WGS.645&instructorName=&search=Search\"> Course Evaluation for WGS.645</a>","Instructor":["Consult Graduate Program in Women's Studies"]},{"type":"LectureSession","label":"L01WGS.S10","timeAndPlace":"W EVE (7-10 PM) VIRTUAL","in-charge":"undefined (Class Admin)","lecture-section-of":"WGS.S10"},{"type":"Class","id":"WGS.S10","label":"Special Subject in Women's and Gender Studies","shortLabel":"Spec Subj: Wmn's & Gndr Stdies","level":"Undergraduate","total-units":12,"units":"3-0-9","course":"WGS","description":"Covers topics not included in regular curriculum; taught in seminar format.
